    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This seafood staple is a somewhat fast meal that can be made for a family dinner meal or served at a dinner
        party. You can swap different pastas out as well depending on your mood (i.e. use angel hair for a lighter
        meal).
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; cook linguine in boiling water until nearly tender, 6 to 8
            minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir

            minutes. Season shrimp with kosher salt and black pepper; add to the skillet and cook until pink, stirring
            occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove shrimp from skillet and keep warm.

        <li>Pour white wine and lemon juice into skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off
            of the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in skillet, stir 2 tablespoons

            mixture until coated; season with salt and black pepper. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon olive oil to serve.
