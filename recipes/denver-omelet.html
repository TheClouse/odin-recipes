    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup diced smoked ham</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of diced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of diced green bell pepper</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt and
            pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure
            ingredients are evenly distributed. Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese
            and cayenne pepper over omelet.
        </li>
        <li>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to
            fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate.
        </li>
