# odin-recipes
My first practice webpage about cooking recipes that will be revisited to update as I get more experience.

## Introduction
This section will include details about what I will be creating and what I hope to accomplish during my first task. Later I will come back and see what I can improve upon and add more detail such as CSS, JS, etc. 

The first part of this assignment will be to create a simple webpage designed to display links to different recipes for some of my favorite food dishes. Each of these links will have a picture of the finished product, an unordered list of the ingredients, and an ordered list for the steps to creating the dish.
